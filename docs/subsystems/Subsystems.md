# Subsystems

## Overview
The subsystems are the physical systems on the robot. Their subsystem files contain all the methods that allow you to control a particular system. The subsystem file should be made as safely as possible. The subsystem can overide anything, so it should be able to limit the motors so it does not damage itself. 

## Files
