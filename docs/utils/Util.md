# Utils

## Overview
The util class provides classes made by us to be carried over year by year to run the robot. 
They are not some locked down thing, they can be adjusted for the needs of the robot however 
the focus should be to prioritize carrying the files over year by year 
*** Consider inheriting the file to adjust for year by year needs ***

## Files
- [Util.h](/docs/utils/Utilh.md)
- [Swerve Files](/docs/utils/Swerve/Swerve.md)
